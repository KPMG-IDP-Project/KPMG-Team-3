# CLA Summarization Project 

The client analyzes hundreds of new **collective labour agreements (CLA)** on an annual basis, in order to interpret practical impact and implement them if necessary. 

Due to the **high volume** (>30 / week) of these **extensive documents**, this is a time consuming process. The task of collecting and processing these new collective agreements needs to be **accelerated and automated**, in order to **enable proactive notification**. 

Using the available metadata and Artificial Intelligence (NLP) the **relevant information** will be **extracted** from the documents. The client needs this information in a **structured way**, so **integrations** with existing platforms and/or new **reporting** are possible.

## Getting Started

The **collective labour agreements (CLA)** are in *pdf* format and can be obtained from the following website: 

[CAO Zoeken](https://werk.belgie.be/nl/themas/paritaire-comites-en-collectieve-arbeidsovereenkomsten-caos/collectieve-4)

The **metadata** of these CLA's are compiled by the client and provided in a spreadsheet.
